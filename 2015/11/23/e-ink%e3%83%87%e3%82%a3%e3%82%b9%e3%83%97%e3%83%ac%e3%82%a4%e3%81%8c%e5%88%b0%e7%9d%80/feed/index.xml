Welcome, Mr.STEFAN.
English version of the page does not have, but you should consider the future.

Simple steps to make the two .bin file of your question is in the middle that are currently summarized.

Fragmentary information can be seen below.
/?s=espeink+make

SDK is planning to use a 1.0.1 or 1.4.0. 1.0.1 In a possible compilation, I was sure that the two .bin file is created.

Then, the author of Mr.Sprite_tm were commented on the forum.
http://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&#038;t=5748
He seems to have updated the code.

I am still unconfirmed, but plan to use the ESP13 (or ESP-WROOM-02).

Please come to play also. Progress is seen in the following.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey man,
I really interested in this project because we want to use this as a base for our Study Project in our university. Your page is really great, but it&#039;s a little bit sad that you didn&#039;t write it in englisch.
Could you make a short introduction in englisch how to generate the two .bin files? 
Because with googletranslater sometimes it is really hard to understand what you actually mean :/ 
So you used the 0.95 sdk at the end or which one?

Would be really nice if you could answer all my questions over mail or with a comment.

Thanks!]]></description>
